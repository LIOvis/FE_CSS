            "The vibe is pure gothic heaven. I had the ‘Blood Velvet Swirl’ and
            nearly sold my soul for another scoop. The candles, the cobwebs, the
            skull spoons—this place is an aesthetic dream (or nightmare,
            depending on your vibe)."

            "Dead Sprinkles Society is the only place where I feel seen while
            eating a black sesame lavender cone under a faux gargoyle. 10/10.
            Would haunt again."

            "Their 'Ashes to Ashes' charcoal brownie scoop changed my life. Lost
            a bit of my soul in the process, but it was totally worth it. Minor
            point off for the fact that the fog machine was out when I went."

            "Finally, an ice cream shop that understands my inner darkness and
            sweet tooth. Gothic elegance with sprinkles of doom. The 'Funeral
            Fudge Ripple' was to die for—literally. I think I saw a ghost."

            organ covers of The Cure while you eat. Whoever thought of black
            waffle cones with edible silver flakes is a genius. I’m obsessed."

            "I came for the velvet and cobwebs, stayed for the Peanut Butter
            Pickle Surprise. I don’t know what kind of dark sorcery makes peanut
            butter and pickled plum taste like they belong together, but I’m not
            asking questions. It’s weird. It’s wonderful. It’s everything Dead
            Sprinkles Society stands for—beautifully bizarre and
            unapologetically bold.

          <h4>Black Sesame Lavender</h4>
          <br />
          <div class="line-break-2"></div>
          <p>
            Earthy black sesame meets ethereal lavender in this beautifully
            balanced blend of shadow and bloom. Smooth, smoky, and floral, it’s
            a flavor that lingers like a whispered secret in a candlelit room.
            Delicate, dark, and utterly enchanting.

          <br />
          <div class="line-break-2"></div>
          <p>
            Rich charcoal-infused cream folded with chunks of decadent fudge
            brownie—this flavor is smoky, sinful, and unapologetically dark. A
            tribute to sweet endings and darker cravings, Ashes to Ashes tastes
            like dessert at the end of the world.

          <br />
          <div class="line-break-2"></div>
          <p>
            A hauntingly rich blend of red velvet and black cherry, tangled in a
            ribbon of dark chocolate fudge. Decadent, dramatic, and just a
            little dangerous—this signature swirl is as smooth as velvet and as
            bold as a midnight vow. One bite, and you’re hooked for eternity.

          <br />
          <div class="line-break-2"></div>
          <p>
            A deep, dark chocolate base laced with thick ribbons of bittersweet
            fudge, Funeral Fudge Ripple is indulgence dressed in mourning. Rich,
            somber, and satisfyingly dramatic—this flavor is perfect for those
            who like their sweets with a side of sorrow.

          <div class="line-break-2"></div>
          <p>
            Sweet, salty, and just a little sinister. Creamy peanut butter
            collides with the sharp tang of pickled plum in this bold,
            bewildering blend. It shouldn’t work—but it haunts you in the best
            way. For the daring souls who crave the unexpected.

          <h4>Midnight Monarch</h4>
          <br />
          <div class="line-break-2"></div>
          <p>
            A silky blend of blackberry, violet cream, and a hint of anise, this
            regal scoop is as mysterious as it is mesmerizing. Served in a
            jet-black waffle cone and dusted with edible silver flakes, Midnight
            Monarch is decadence in its final form—floral, fruity, and faintly
            forbidden.
