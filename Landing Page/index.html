          <h1>Overview</h1>
          <p>
            Invader Zim is an animated dark comedy and sci-fi series created by
            Jhonen Vasquez. Premiering on Nickelodeon in 2001, the show follows
            the misadventures of Zim, an overzealous but incompetent alien from
            the Irken Empire. Sent to Earth on a bogus mission (basically to get
            rid of him), Zim is determined to conquer the planet and prove his
            worth to the almighty Irken leaders known as the Tallest.
          </p>

          <p>
            To blend in, Zim disguises himself (poorly) as a human child and
            enrolls in school, where he clashes constantly with Dib, a
            paranormal investigator who sees through his disguise and tries to
            expose him. Zim’s plans for world domination are also repeatedly
            foiled by his own clueless robot sidekick, GIR, whose chaotic antics
            often sabotage Zim’s efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            The show is known for its twisted humor, grotesque visuals, and
            satirical take on alien invasion tropes. While it was short-lived,
            it has gained a massive cult following for its offbeat characters,
            distinctive art style, and hilarious cynicism.

              Jhonen Vasquez is an American cartoonist, comic book writer, and
              animator known for his dark, satirical humor and distinctive,
              highly stylized artwork. Born on September 1, 1974, in San Jose,
              California, Vasquez developed a fascination with horror and
              surrealism early on, which would later heavily influence his work.
            </p>

            <p>
              He first gained attention with the self-published comic Johnny the
              Homicidal Maniac (1995), a darkly comedic, ultra-violent series
              about a disturbed serial killer. This was followed by similarly
              twisted works like Squee!, I Feel Sick, and Fillerbunny, which
              cemented Vasquez’s reputation for black humor, edgy social
              commentary, and gothic-inspired visuals.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2001, Vasquez brought his singular vision to television with
              Invader Zim, a children’s animated series that pushed the
              boundaries of what could air on Nickelodeon. Despite its short
              run, Invader Zim became a cult classic thanks to Vasquez’s unique
              sense of humor, offbeat characters, and willingness to embrace the
              bizarre.
            </p>

            <p>
              Vasquez has continued to dabble in various projects, from comic
              book work to graphic design and occasional animation. While not as
              publicly prolific as some creators, he remains a beloved figure in
              the alternative comics and animation scene, respected for his
              irreverent, pitch-black wit and creative world-building.

              The Invader Zim comic series is an officially licensed
              continuation of the original 2001–2006 animated TV show Invader
              Zim. Published by Oni Press, the comic launched in July 2015 and
              ran until 2020, spanning 50 regular issues along with some special
              editions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Written and overseen by series creator Jhonen Vasquez, the comics
              bring back the weird, satirical tone of the show, reuniting fans
              with Zim, his malfunctioning robot sidekick GIR, and his
              ever-vigilant human nemesis Dib. The comics maintain the darkly
              comedic style of the show, mixing outlandish sci-fi plots with
              Vasquez’s trademark snark and visual flair.
            </p>

            <p>
              The comic issues often feature standalone misadventures, with
              storylines like Zim’s attempt to conquer Earth using increasingly
              absurd methods, GIR’s chaotic schemes, or Dib’s futile efforts to
              expose Zim’s alien identity. Despite their episodic nature, the
              comics also explore new alien species and Irken technology,
              expanding on the TV show’s world in a fun and twisted way.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Invader Zim comic series was praised for capturing the spirit
              of the original while giving fans more of the grim, hilarious
              mayhem they loved. It remains a beloved companion to the cult
              classic show, especially for fans who never quite got enough of
              Zim’s doomed invasion efforts.
